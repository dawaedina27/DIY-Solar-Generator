#DIY Solar Generator

A DIY solar generator is a self-contained and portable mini-power plant that you can use to power and charge your gadgets and even small appliances and be 100% independent from the grid.


#Tools

> A set of Phillips, flat and Torx screwdrivers.

> 111-240V hot glue gun.

> Automatic wire stripper with cutter.

> Utility knife.

> Files.

> Cordless drill with drill bits and grinding extensions.




#Parts and Components (Materials)

* Solar panel: The solar panel absorbs the sun’s energy and supplies it to the battery. Your panel will be one of the most exposed elements of the generator, so it needs to be high-quality and durable as well.

* Rugged case: You need a waterproof, weatherproof, and above all sturdy casing that will hold all the vital parts.
It needs a Rugged Case which is fitted with several rugged handles, as well as a pair of rolling wheels eg "Pelican 1620 Case"

* AC solar power inverter: With a solar power inverter, you transform the DC voltage that is stored in your battery into AC voltage that appliances use.

* Battery: Your generator needs a battery to store solar energy. Batteries come in all shapes and sizes, but your best shot is either a lithium-ion or deep-cycle lead-acid battery.

* Solar charge controller: This component prevents your battery from overcharging by regulating the voltage and current levels coming from the solar panel.

* Battery maintainer: A battery maintainer is a small battery charger that supplies your battery with a small amount of electricity when it stays inactive for long periods.

* AC power inlet: This is the external inlet on the hard case.

* LED flood light: Fit your generator with powerful and reliable LED floodlights so you can use it as a light source around your campsite, boat or during a power outage at home.

#Steps/ Instructions on Building a DIY Solar Generator

Now that you have all your equipment and tools it’s time to build a Diy solar generator for your own. As building a solar generator isn’t the kind of project that just anyone can handle, but if you’re handy and interested, it’s a great way to get better energy efficiency and protection at a better price than ready-made systems.

The basic process to create your own panel consists of the following procedures.

** Calculate Your Energy Needs. Take a look at your energy bill if you're building the system for use in your home.

** Test the Parts.

** Mount Your Components. 
                        > Set out all elements. Then find a spot you’d like to place your inverter to get an easy access. 
                         
                        > Once you’ve selected your spot, drill a hole underneath the inverter, pass your wire through the hole and intothe                           cooler, and put Velcro just above that spot to secure your inverter in position.
                         
                        > Once you have a voltage meter, make room for it and do the same thing ideally next to the inverter. 
                        
                        > Then add your battery to your inverter for electricity. First add the negative post, then the positive one. In the                           corner put the battery in the cooler, and velcro back.
                        
                        > Drill another hole in the top of your cooler by your other components, and set down velcro for the charge controller. Now, run the outgoing wires through the hole, and connect to the battery using the above directions.
Drill a hole on the side of the controller to run the solar panel’s cord into.
Find a spot for your solar panel to be set up. Place the panel towards the sun and attach the cord to the charging controller within your “device.” Allow the battery to charge at least 50 percent. Now you are able to use the generator to fuel the inverter.

** Wire Everything Together.

** Plug in Your Devices.
